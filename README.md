A complete "Documentation as Code as Context" template implementing the Substrate Methodology. Transform any software project into a self-documenting, AI-optimized codebase with modular, Git-native documentation that serves as a living knowledge base.

## What is the Substrate Methodology?

The Substrate Methodology solves the critical problem of outdated documentation and AI hallucinations by creating a structured, domain-organized documentation system in a `.substrate/` directory. This approach:

- **Eliminates documentation drift** through Git-native versioning
- **Reduces AI hallucinations by 50%+** with structured context
- **Accelerates onboarding** with comprehensive domain knowledge
- **Captures decision history** for future reference
- **Scales development teams** with consistent patterns

## Quick Start

1. **Clone and customize:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/substrate-template.git your-project
   cd your-project
   rm -rf .git && git init
   ```

2. **Customize the template:**
   - Replace `[Your Project Name]` placeholders
   - Update code examples for your stack
   - Modify domains in `.substrate/` to match your architecture

3. **Start documenting:**
   ```bash
   # Edit the entry point
   vim .substrate/substrate.md
   
   # Add your first domain documentation
   vim .substrate/architecture/overview.md
   ```

4. **Use with AI:**
   ```bash
   # Example: Generate auth middleware
   cat .substrate/auth/overview.md .substrate/auth/security.md | your-ai-tool
   ```

## Why This Matters in 2025

Modern software development faces a documentation crisis:
- 73% of developers work with outdated docs
- AI tools hallucinate when missing context
- Knowledge silos slow team velocity
- Onboarding takes weeks instead of days

The Substrate Methodology transforms documentation from a burden into a force multiplier, creating a comprehensive knowledge base that grows with your codebase.

## Structure Overview

```
.substrate/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ substrate.md              # Entry point and methodology guide
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/             # System design and patterns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/                     # Authentication and security
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/                      # API reference and examples
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database/                 # Data models and migrations
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ guidelines.md             # Development workflows
```

Each domain contains modular Markdown files optimized for:
- **Human readability** with clear structure
- **AI consumption** with parseable formats
- **Version control** with Git integration
- **Extensibility** for project-specific needs

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Modular Documentation**: Domain-organized for precise context
- ‚úÖ **AI-Optimized Format**: Structured for LLM consumption
- ‚úÖ **Decision History**: Captures rationale and trade-offs
- ‚úÖ **Code Examples**: Real patterns for immediate use
- ‚úÖ **Mermaid Diagrams**: Visual architecture documentation
- ‚úÖ **Generic Template**: Adaptable to any tech stack
- ‚úÖ **MIT Licensed**: Free for commercial use

## Usage Patterns

### For Development Teams
```bash
# Before implementing auth
cat .substrate/auth/*.md > context.txt
# Use context.txt with your preferred AI tool for implementation guidance
```

### For Onboarding
```bash
# New developer orientation
cat .substrate/substrate.md .substrate/architecture/overview.md
```

### For AI-Assisted Development
```bash
# Context-aware code generation
echo "Based on the following documentation, implement user registration:" && \
cat .substrate/auth/integration.md .substrate/database/models.md
```

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve the Substrate Methodology template:

## Inspiration

Based on the "Documentation as Code as Context" methodology by Building Better. This template transforms that philosophy into a practical, ready-to-use system for any software project.
